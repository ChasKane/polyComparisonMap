    title: "Insecurity"
    ,text: `An amorphous thing, insecurity underlies many struggles in non-monogamy and is difficult to defeat because it's hard to identify, let alone understand. It's like trying to swat a fly -- sometimes you think you have it down, but it's actually nowhere near your grasp, and other times it just goes away temporarily without explanation. Like your reflexes though, resilience against insecurity can be trained.

Some advice I've heard regarding insecurity around being compared, or fearing that you're being compared:
* **You're unique**: to your partners, being with you is a nearly incomparable experience, just as being with your other partners is very different from being with them. This gives you a solid foundation of importance to them. Even a specific act like kissing may not be objectively better or worse with you, just different. Often, the desirability of specific intimate acts varies over time, and aren't worth fretting about.
* **Consider parallels**: what would you say of parents that tell their children that they love one child more than another? It's just not a helpful way of going about navigating already hectic waters, morality aside. Let your mind gently simmer with similar situations to your own that have different archetypes, dynamics, and feels. **Poly lover comparisons ≅ mother-daughter comparisons ≅ boss-subordinate comparisons.** How would you feel if your boss compared you negatively to your coworkers? What about if positively? What if you're the boss doing the comparing?

    title: "Shared Learning"
    ,text: `We're used to learning from others when they know more about a particular, inanimate topic than we do, but what about learning from those who are experts in the same field as us, but who know different things about it? What if the field you're both differing experts in is your shared partner?

Why is it that when we meet a fellow yoga teacher, mother, or xenobiology theorist, we're overjoyed, but all of society teaches us to be on edge about those who are experts in knowing and loving our romantic partners? Metamours are among the greatest sources of information and perspectives on the people you love, next to parents and decades-long best-friends. Sit and chat with them about your lover's

    title: "Born This Way?"
    ,text: `I used to convince myself that it was important how fast I achieved certain life milestones, and that everyone was racing toward the same ones. Some people, it seemed, were born secure, funny, attractive, savants at their careers, and with 1000 amazing hobbies from the get-go.

Nothing has helped me with my imposter syndrome more than understanding how privilege and probabilities interact, and that it's ok to, for example, be more insecure than most people (as long as that insecurity doesn't hurt others) because I shouldn't **expect** to have the emotional security that someone with a different romance origin story (a form of relative privilege) is *likely but not guaranteed* to have.

    title: "Scarcity Mentality"
    ,text: `I had a long and hard journey on the way to learning to manifest my good social and emotional intentions. Even on that path when I was awkward, deliberately inflammatory, I still had plenty of people who loved me, but they didn't love me in exactly the ways I wanted. It was up to my mentality what I made of that situation, and I didn't always make the best of it. I would fixate on how few sexual partners I had been with, and on how few of the people I met seemed to enjoy discussing how to optimize political systems. When I finally did meet someone I was sexual with and with whom I felt fulfilled in conversation, I fixated just as hard on ~~how amazing the experience was in the moment~~ how to keep the one person who I felt completed me. Like smoke, she was, and rightfully so -- as my grip tightened around what I perceived to be a scare resource, she withdrew.

This was (and sometimes still is) **scarcity mentality**: fixating on what you don't have when you don't have it, and on how to keep it at all costs when you do. It took a long time for me to hear about, let alone begin to master, the **abundance mentality**. This is the two-pronged opposite:
* Don't give up all desires necessarily (though if you want to take an eastern route, I can report that abandoning desires has worked, at least in many areas of my life (see minimalism) ), but do practice mental habits building gratefulness for what's in front of you and building confidence that what you desire will come soon enough if you focus on more actionable desires now.
* When you have what you want, recognize that you don't **need** it to survive, that you got along well enough (because you were building those mental habits mentioned above) before you had it, and that you don't own it (if it's a person).

So defined, **scarcity mentality is built on fallacies**. Just as statically typed languages aren't always better in software development and locking a door that turns out to be easily carded doesn't make a robbery much less likely, **trying really hard to not let a partner go won't work** unless you're taking notes on what might make you a better partner (as we're doing to figure out what tasks static typing works better for) and testing to see which strategies actually work and aren't just *comforting but card-able* defenses (against breakups you'll live through regardless, I promise).

    title: "Silence"
    ,description: `Some people prefer not to know anything about their metamours (lovers of their lovers), others prefer to hear everything except information about key issues like their sex life or whether they've been to the same places with their lover as they themselves have. There are many variants on this tactic, but the central theme is *out of sight, out of mind* -- "I won't feel compared if I'm never told anything about his other lovers, right?"
    `
    ,reflections: `I'm a strong believer against silence of any kind -- I prefer to be completely open with my partners about anything that is mine to tell. The answer to the question above, I think, is a solid "wrong" because painful things slip, even non-verbally. Plus, this tactic precludes you from having the wonderful metamour relationships poly is uniquely good at fostering (see shared learning), and it prevents you from growing from difficult but virtuous experiences.

    title: "Compare all the time?"
    ,description: `Use comparison among partners as a way to help everyone grow. If Nikki's open to hearing this kind of feedback, she may find out no other way that she has a lot of room for improvement in the spiritual discussion department than by hearing herself compared to her metamour.
    `
    ,reflections: `This may seem counter-intuitive, but comparisons can promote growth, given a lot of practice honing the right mindset. In my experience, there's always a period of insecurity when I hear (or think I hear) that a metamour is better at something I care about than I am, but this is my emotion to work through. Sometimes it's so difficult that I need space from the situation, but I don't let myself lash out -- that wouldn't be a fair response to genuine (if perhaps sometimes reckless) openness. As a reward for this composure, I consistently learn more about myself, my partners, each of our preferences, their metamours (who are typically wonderful people well worth knowing), and humanity than I would have had I shut the pain out. This is a choice I make that's worked well for me, and don't expect it of everyone.

So go ahead, **compare me to your other partners**. Do so with empathy, care, respect, and only pure intentions. Do so while **actively listening to how I'm taking the information**. Tell me that they're better at oral sex, and tell me why, what they do, and whether you have ideas for how to spice things up between us. Tell me that they're better at keeping track of, and sticking to, personal goals, and tell me what systems they use and what lessons they've learned on their journey -- heck, introduce me to them with that as a talking point. Ideate with me on how I might adopt their strategies or seek out my own.

Most importantly, ask first. Just as you would ask before performing a dangerous procedure involving a needle, a balloon, and a sleepy ex-marine that could trigger their PTSD, ask before bringing up a topic that has a non-trivial chance of hurting me if I'm unprepared.
