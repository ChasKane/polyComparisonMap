Polyamory is a romantic/sexual pattern where people have multiple informed, consensual relationships at a time. It's distinct from the sex-only, no-feelings-allowed vibe of swinging, and though there is often crossover with the kink/BDSM scene, poly people are not always kinky.

If this is the first time you're hearing about polyamory, welcome to an opportunity to learn about *but not necessarily convert to, and hopefully not feel threatened by* a non-traditional way of approaching romance and sex. For a general introduction to poly, I've never seen a better overview than the first few chapters of this book:

This project is aimed at those who are having trouble with the *common and ok-to-have* difficulty of comparison among multiple partners in a poly setting. The principles outlined, however, can be used in any interpersonal scenario -- as with most things poly, the lessons we learn don't just work for poly situations!

Inspiration from many conversations with partners and other wonderful people, mono and poly alike, as well as the following pages:

Color pallet generated using `https://coolors.co` and is based on my personal brand, but with more emphasis on passion and strife, with notes of harmony gleamed from the battles fought in the compilation of this work.
